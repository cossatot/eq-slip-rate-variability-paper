	abstract = {The Bulnay earthquake of 23 July 1905 (Mw 8.3–8.5), in north‐central Mongolia, is one of the world’s largest recorded intracontinental earthquakes and one of four great earthquakes that occurred in the region during the twentieth century. The 375 km long surface rupture of the left‐lateral, strike‐slip, N095°E‐trending Bulnay fault associated with this earthquake is remarkable for its pronounced expression across the landscape and for the size of features produced by previous earthquakes. Our field observations suggest that in many areas the width and geometry of the rupture zone is the result of repeated earthquakes; however, in those areas where it is possible to determine that the geomorphic features are the result of the 1905 surface rupture alone, the size of the features produced by this single earthquake are singular in comparison to most other historical strike‐slip surface ruptures worldwide. Along the 80 km stretch, between 97.18° E and 98.33° E, the fault zone is characterized by several meters width and the mean left‐lateral 1905 offset is 8.9±0.6 m with two measured cumulative offsets that are twice the 1905 slip. These observations suggest that the displacement produced during the penultimate event was similar to the 1905 slip. Morphotectonic analyses carried out at three sites along the eastern part of the Bulnay fault allow us to estimate a mean horizontal slip rate of 3.1±1.7 mm/yr over the Late Pleistocene–Holocene period. In parallel, paleoseismological investigations show evidence for two earthquakes prior to the 1905 event, with recurrence intervals of ∼2700–4000 yrs.

A new record of earthquake recurrence has been developed at Hokuri Creek, with evidence for 22 events. The youngest Hokuri Creek earthquake overlaps in time and is believed to be the same as the oldest of another site about 100 km to the northwest near Haast. The combined record spans the last 7900 years and includes 24 events. We study the recurrence rate and conditional probability of ground ruptures from this record using a new likelihood‐based approach for estimation of recurrence model parameters. Paleoseismic parameter estimation includes both dating and natural recurrence uncertainties. Lognormal and Brownian passage time (BPT) models are considered. The likelihood surface has distribution location and width parameters as axes, the mean and standard deviation of the log recurrence for the lognormal, and the mean and coefficient of variation for the BPT. The maximum‐likelihood (ML) point gives the parameters most likely to have given rise to the data. The ML point, 50‐year conditional probabilities of a ground‐rupturing earthquake are 26.8\% and 26.1\% for the lognormal and BPT models, respectively. Contours of equal likelihood track the parameter pairs that are equally probable to have given rise to the observed data. Conditional probabilities on the lognormal 95\% boundary around the ML point range from 18.2\% to 35.8\%. An empirical distribution model completely based on past recurrence times gives a similar conditional probability of 27.1\% (9.6\%–50.2\%). In contrast, the time‐independent conditional probability estimate of 13.6\% (8.8\%–19.1\%) is about half that of the time‐dependent models. A nonparametric test of earthquake recurrence at Hokuri Creek indicates that time‐dependent recurrence models best represent the southern Alpine fault of the South Island, New Zealand.},

Estimating the hazards associated with possible large earthquakes depends largely on evidence of prior seismic activity. The relatively new global seismic networks installed to monitor earthquakes, however, have only captured the very recent history of fault zones that can remain active for thousands of years. To understand the recurrence of large earthquakes along the Alpine Fault in New Zealand, Berryman et al. (p. 1690) looked to the sediments near an old creek for evidence of surface ruptures and vertical offset. Along this fault segment, 24 large earthquakes seem to have occurred over the last 6000 years, resulting in a recurrence interval of ∼329 years. The activity is more regular than other similar strike-slip faults, such as the San Andreas Fault in California.
The scarcity of long geological records of major earthquakes, on different types of faults, makes testing hypotheses of regular versus random or clustered earthquake recurrence behavior difficult. We provide a fault-proximal major earthquake record spanning 8000 years on the strike-slip Alpine Fault in New Zealand. Cyclic stratigraphy at Hokuri Creek suggests that the fault ruptured to the surface 24 times, and event ages yield a 0.33 coefficient of variation in recurrence interval. We associate this near-regular earthquake recurrence with a geometrically simple strike-slip fault, with high slip rate, accommodating a high proportion of plate boundary motion that works in isolation from other faults. We propose that it is valid to apply time-dependent earthquake recurrence models for seismic hazard estimation to similar faults worldwide.
Evidence of past earthquakes from sediments along New Zealand’s Alpine Fault improves seismic hazard estimates.

We collected 800 samples from the well-preserved limestone scarps of the faults and modeled their 36Cl concentrations to derive their seismic exhumation history. We found that {\textgreater} 30 large earthquakes broke the faults in synchrony over the last 12 ka. The seven faults released strain at the same periods of time, 12–9 ka, 5–3 ka, and 1.5–1 ka. On all faults, the strain accumulation and release occurred in 3–6 ka supercycles, each included a 3–5 ka phase of slow (≤ 0.5–2 mm/yr) strain accumulation in relative quiescence, followed by a cluster of three to four large earthquakes or earthquake sequences that released most of the strain in {\textless} 1–2 ka. The large earthquakes repeated every 0.5 ± 0.3 ka during the paroxysmal phases and every 4.3 ± 0.9 ka between those phases. Earthquakes on the northern faults produced twice larger surface slips ({\textasciitilde} 2 m) and had larger magnitudes (Mw 6.2–6.7) than those on the southern faults. On most faults, the relative strain level was found to control the amount of slip and the time of occurrence of the next large earthquake. Faults entered a phase of clustered activity once they had reached a specific relative strain threshold. The Tre Monti fault is identified as the most prone to break over the next century.

The Cadell Fault, found in stable continental region (SCR) crust in southeastern Australia, provides a record of temporally clustered morphogenic earthquakes spanning much of the Cenozoic. The slip rate, averaged over perhaps as many as five complete seismic cycles in the period 70–20 ka, is c. 0.4–0.5 mm a−1, compared with an average rate of c. 0.005–0.01 mm a−1 over the period spanning the late Miocene to Recent. If full length rupture of the 80 km long feature is assumed, the average recurrence for Mw 7.3–7.5 earthquake events on the Cadell Fault in the period 70–20 ka is c. 8 kyr. About 20 kyr, representing more than two average seismic cycles, have lapsed since the most recent morphogenic seismic event on the fault. It might therefore be speculated that this fault has relapsed into a quiescent period. Episodic rupture behaviour on the Cadell Fault, and nearby faults in Phanerozoic SCR crust in eastern Australia, might be controlled by their linkage into major crustal fault systems at depth, in apparent contrast with the style of deformation in non-extended Precambrian SCR crust. Periods of strain localization on these major crustal fault systems, effectively turning deforming regions ‘on’ and ‘off’, might be influenced by changes in distant plate boundary forces. If proved, this would have profound consequences for how the occurrence of large earthquakes is assessed in Australia, as the fundamental assumption of morphogenic earthquakes occurring as a result of the progressive build-up of strain, and thus being in some way predictable in their periodicity, is not satisfied. Documenting such fault behaviour in SCR crust assists in conceptualizing the points critical to understanding the hazards posed by SCR faults worldwide.

	abstract = {Geological studies show evidence for temporal clustering of large earthquakes on individual fault systems. Since post-seismic deformation due to the inelastic rheology of the lithosphere may result in a variable loading rate on a fault throughout the interseismic period, it is reasonable to expect that the rheology of the non-seismogenic lower crust and mantle lithosphere may play a role in controlling earthquake recurrence times. We study this phenomenon using a 2-D, finite element method continuum model of the lithosphere containing a single strike-slip fault. This model builds on a previous study using a 1-D spring-dashpot-slider analogue of a single fault system to study the role of Maxwell viscoelastic relaxation in producing non-periodic earthquakes. In our 2-D model, the seismogenic portion of the fault slips when a predetermined yield stress is exceeded; stress accumulated on the seismogenic fault is shed to the viscoelastic layers below and recycled back to the seismogenic fault through viscoelastic relaxation. We find that random variation of the fault yield stress from one earthquake to the next can cause the earthquake sequence to be clustered; the amount of clustering depends on a non-dimensional number, W, called the Wallace number defined as the standard deviation of the randomly varied fault yield stress divided by the effective viscosity of the system times the tectonic loading rate. A new clustering metric based on the bimodal distribution of interseismic intervals allows us to investigate clustering behaviour of systems over a wide range of model parameters and those with multiple viscoelastic layers. For models with W ≥ 1 clustering increases with increasing W, while those with W ≤ 1 are unclustered, or quasi-periodic.},

By substituting these equations into the definition of seismic moment ({\textless}img class="highwire-embed" alt="Embedded Image" src="http://bssa.geoscienceworld.org.www2.lib.ku.edu/sites/default/files/highwire/ssabull/100/5A/1971/embed/inline-graphic-2.gif"/{\textgreater}), I have developed a series of self-consistent equations that describe the scaling between seismic moment, rupture area, length, width, and average displacement. In addition to β, the equations have only two variables, C1 and C2, which have been estimated empirically for different tectonic settings. The relations predict linear log–log relationships, the slope of which depends only on β.
These new scaling relations, unlike previous relations, are self-consistent, in that they enable moment, rupture length, width, area, and displacement to be estimated from each other and with these estimates all being consistent with the definition of seismic moment. I interpret C1 as depending on the size at which a rupture transitions from having a constant aspect ratio to following a power law and C2 as depending on the displacement per unit area of fault rupture and so static stress drop. It is likely that these variables differ between tectonic environments; this might explain much of the scatter in the empirical data.
I suggest that these relations apply to all faults. For small earthquakes (M{\textless}∼5) β=1, in which case L3 fault scaling applies. For larger (M{\textgreater}∼5) earthquakes β=2/3, so L2.5 applies. For dip-slip earthquakes this scaling applies up to the largest events. For very large (M{\textgreater}∼7.2) strike-slip earthquakes, which are fault width-limited, β=0 and assuming {\textless}img class="highwire-embed" alt="Embedded Image" src="http://bssa.geoscienceworld.org.www2.lib.ku.edu/sites/default/files/highwire/ssabull/100/5A/1971/embed/inline-graphic-3.gif"/{\textgreater}, then L1.5 scaling applies. In all cases, M0∝A1.5 fault scaling applies.},

Event evidence, in the form of buried fissures, scarps, folds, and upward terminations, has allowed us to identify six well-resolved earthquakes, designated as events W, U, R, Q, K, and F, within the last ∼7000 years. The exposures that we excavated did not reveal additional evidence for three poorly resolved events reported by McGill and Rockwell [1998]. Evidence for event Y, identified in the previous study, was reexamined and found not to be a paleoearthquake. Radiocarbon dates of detrital charcoal, combined with a method of interpolating the event ages with revised sedimentation rates, provide our preferred constraints on the timing of faulting events. The most recent surface-rupturing earthquake, event W, occurred between A.D. 1450 and 1640. The penultimate event U occurred between A.D. 675 and 950. Event R, which was unrecognized in the previous study, occurred between A.D. 250 and 475. Event Q occurred relatively shortly before event R, between A.D. 25 and 275. Event K occurred between 3340 and 2930 B.C. The oldest identified paleoearthquake, event F, occurred between 5300 and 4670 B.C. The event ages indicate that earthquake recurrence is highly irregular at the El Paso Peaks site, with individual preferred intervals ranging from as little as 215 years to as many as 3300 years. The irregular recurrence of surface-rupturing earthquakes along the central Garlock fault may be related to temporal and spatial clustering of earthquakes proposed for faults in the Eastern California Shear Zone.},

We combine detailed ﬁeld surﬁcial mapping, topographic surveying, and 10Be cosmogenic nuclide exposure ages to calculate new late Pleistocene and Holocene slip rates on the Lone Mountain fault. Alluvial fans with ages of 14.6 ± 1.4 ka and 8.0 ± 0.9 ka are vertically offset 10.2 ± 0.6 m and 4.7 ± 0.6 m, respectively, yielding vertical slip rates of 0.7 ± 0.1 mm/yr and 0.6 ± 0.1 mm/yr. These slip rates are faster than the rates of 0.1 to 0.4 mm/yr from earlier in the Pleistocene, deﬁning a pattern of accelerating slip on the Lone Mountain fault over a timescale of 104 years. The possibility of accelerating slip rates in parts of the Walker Lane partially reconciles the observed discrepancy between long- and short-term slip rates in this region and elucidates the distribution of strain across an evolving plate boundary.},

Our main concern is analysis of the data in which some occurrence times of events themselves are uncertain and given by intervals or some distributions. Specifically, we consider a Bayesian inference where each uncertainty is interpreted as a prior distribution associated with likelihood of a renewal process model. Integration of the posterior with respect to the occurrence times and its maximization with respect to the parameters of the renewal process model are implemented in order to estimate the parameters and further to compare the goodness of fit of other competing renewal process models. Thus the posterior of the selected model provides a reasonable estimate of distribution of uncertain occurrence times associated with the fitted renewal process model. Finally, in a case where occurrence time of the last event is uncertain, a practical method for the assessment of current and future hazard of the forthcoming rupture is provided.},

The Lisan represents more than 10 times the 4000 years of historical earthquake records. It is the longest and most complete paleoseismic record along the Dead Sea Transform and possibly the longest continuous record on Earth. It includes unique exposures of seismite beds (earthquake?induced structures) associated with slip events on syndepositional faults. The seismites are layers consisting of mixtures of fragmented and pulverized laminae. The places where the seismites abut syndepositional faults are interpreted as evidence for their formation at the sediment?water interface during slip events on these faults. Thicker sediment accumulation above the seismites in the downthrown blocks indicates that a seismite formed at the water?sediment interface on both sides of the fault scarps. Modern analogs and the association with surface ruptures suggest that each seismite formed during an ML ≥ 5.5 earthquake. The 230Th?234U ages of a columnar section, obtained by thermal ionization mass spectrometry, give a mean recurrence time of ?1600 years of ML ≥ 5.5 earthquakes in the Dead Sea Graben. The earthquakes cluster in ?10,000?year periods separated by quiet periods of similar length. This distribution implies that a long?term behavior of the Dead Sea Transform should be represented by a mean recurrence of at least 20,000 year record. This observation has ramifications for seismic hazard assessment based on shorter records.},

Variation in fault scarp length, vertical displacement, proximity to other faults and relationship to topography permits division of the continent according to fault character. Six onshore “neotectonic domains” are recognised, with an additional offshore domain proposed by analogy with the eastern United States. Each domain relates to a distinct underlying crustal type and architecture, broadly considered to represent cratonic, non-cratonic and extended environments. In general, greater topographic expression associated with faults occurring in extended crust relative to non-extended crust suggests a higher rate of seismic activity in the former setting, consistent with observations worldwide. Using the same reasoning, non-cratonic crust might be expected to have a higher rate of seismic activity than cratonic crust. This distinction, together with the variation in fault character between domains, should be recognised in attempts to identify analogous systems worldwide.},

These periods of rapid seismic displacement in the Los Angeles region have occurred during the lulls between similar bursts of activity observed on the eastern California shear zone in the Mojave Desert, which is now seismically active. A kinematic model in which the faults of the greater San Andreas system suppress activity on faults in the eastern California shear zone, and vice versa, can explain the apparent switching of activity between the two fault networks. Combined with the observation that short-term geodetic and longer-term geologic rates co-vary on major southern California fault systems, this suggests that either (1) a temporal cluster of seismic displacements on upper-crustal faults increases ductile deformation on their downward extensions, or (2) rapid ductile slip in the lower crust beneath faults loads the upper crust, driving a seismic cluster. We suggest that alternating periods of rapid seismic displacement may be the expected mode of seismicity when two fault systems accommodate the same plate-boundary motion, and slip on one system suppresses slip on the other.},

	abstract = {The paleoseismic record from crustal faults in the Puget Lowland in western Washington State contains {\textasciitilde}30 earthquakes that cut the late Pleistocene glacial surface. This rich dataset, produced by decades of scientific effort by the USGS and collaborators, has dramatic implications for seismic hazard and risk in this densely-populated and economically-vital area, and also provides insight into earthquake processes and fault interaction in crustal fault arrays. However, before the fruits of this labor can be snacked upon, more thorough characterization of these paleoearthquakes is necessary. To these ends, I present a three-pronged approach of ongoing research into this characterization:

1.   Magnitude estimation: Paleoseismological techniques measure earthquake displacement at a study site, which is then used in scaling relationships to infer plausible magnitude ranges for each event. However, the fault geometry can add additional constraints to the magnitude as well. By using Bayesian methods that incorporate both rupture length and point displacement, we decrease both the magnitude and the uncertainty in the magnitude estimation for Puget Lowland earthquakes.

 2.   Earthquake recurrence and survival analysis: The expected time until the next earthquake may depend on the time since the last earthquake, but the form of this dependence is not always obvious. Using the tools of survival analysis (borrowed from biology and engineering), we can calculate the probability of earthquake occurrence in western Washington given the time since the last event based on the statistics of previous events, rather than by assuming a standard statistical model for earthquake recurrence. This empirical technique lets us directly incorporate phenomena such as earthquake triggering and clustering (which are clearly observed in the Puget Lowland) that standard recurrence models cannot.

 3.   Time-dependent seismic hazard and loss analysis: The paleoearthquake record from the Puget Lowland provides quite strong evidence for earthquake triggering and fault interaction to a degree that invalidates the assumptions of time- and space-independence used in classical PSHA. In particular, records of clustered M7+ events within a few years to decades imply that communities with greatly damaged infrastructure from one event may face successive episodes of strong ground shaking.

	abstract = {The fault system responsible for New Madrid seismicity has generated temporally clustered very large earthquakes in A.D. 900 ע 100 years and A.D. 1450 ע 150 years as well as in 1811–1812. Given the uncertainties in dating liquefaction features, the time between the past three New Madrid events may be as short as 200 years and as long as 800 years, with an average of 500 years. This advance in understanding the Late Holocene history of the New Madrid seismic zone and thus, the contemporary tectonic behavior of the associated fault system was made through studies of hundreds of earthquake-induced liquefaction features at more than 250 sites across the New Madrid region. We have found evidence that prehistoric sand blows, like those that formed during the 1811–1812 earthquakes, are probably compound structures resulting from multiple earthquakes closely clustered in time or earthquake sequences. From the spatial distribution and size of sand blows and their sedimentary units, we infer the source zones and estimate the magnitudes of earthquakes within each sequence and thereby characterize the detailed behavior of the fault system. It appears that fault rupture was complex and that the central branch of the seismic zone produced very large earthquakes during the A.D. 900 and A.D. 1450 events as well as in 1811–1812. On the basis of a minimum recurrence rate of 200 years, we are now entering the period during which the next 1811–1812-type event could occur.},

	abstract = {A long-standing debate in active tectonics addresses how slip is accumulated through space and time along a given fault or fault section. This debate is in part still ongoing because of the lack of sufficiently long instrumental data that may constrain the recurrence characteristics of surface-rupturing earthquakes along individual faults. Geomorphic and stratigraphic records are used instead to constrain this behavior. Although geomorphic data frequently indicate slip accumulation via quasicharacteristic same-size offset increments, stratigraphic data indicate that earthquake timing observes a quasirandom distribution. Assuming that both observations are valid within their respective frameworks, I want to address here which recurrence model is able to reproduce this seemingly contradictory behavior. I further want to address how aleatory offset variability and epistemic measurement uncertainty affect our ability to resolve single-earthquake surface slip and along-fault slip-accumulation patterns.},

We conclude by speculating on future areas of research in the next decade.},

We find that Pacific-North America motion has remained steady since 3.16 Ma, but at rates significantly faster than predicted by NUVEL-1A. In the vicinity of Baja California, our GPS-derived model and recent seafloor spreading rates in the southern Gulf of California both indicate that the NUVEL-1A model underestimates Pacific-North America rates by 4±2 mm yr−1. Steady Pacific-North America motion since 3.16 Myr and increasing seafloor spreading rates since 3.58 Myr in the Gulf of California imply that Pacific-North America motion was partitioned between seafloor spreading in the Gulf of California and decelerating slip along faults in or offshore from the Baja peninsula.},

	abstract = {Three M s 8 earthquakes have occurred in Mongolia during a 52-year period (1905{\textasciicircum}1957). Since these earthquakes were well separated in space (400 km), the coseismic stress change is far too low (0.001 bar) to explain mutual earthquake triggering. By contrast, postseismic relaxation gradually causes a significant stress change (0.1{\textasciicircum}0.9 bar) over large distances. Using a spring-slider model to simulate earthquake interaction, we find that viscoelastic stress transfer may be responsible for the earthquake time clustering observed in active tectonic areas. Therefore, revealing postseismic strain by satellite geodesy and modeling earthquake clusters could improve our understanding of earthquake occurrence, especially in zones where large earthquakes have already struck in past decades. ß 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.
